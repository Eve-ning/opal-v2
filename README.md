opal-v2 is *another* accuracy-prediction model.

It's an improvement over the previous [opal](https://github.com/Eve-ning/opal),
which used a heavier algorithm, thus slower and larger model.

The clearest difference you can see is the fact that opal v2 offers a more
explainable approach to skill/rating estimation while opal v1, because of its
internal complexity, requires a lot of black-box testing to achieve this.

The details of implementation of this model is mostly in my blog post:
